-  Hibernate Collections 
	Hibernate uses one of the following semantics in the background to maintain the collections
	-  Bag Semantic - List / ArrayList
	-  Bag semantic with ID - List / ArrayList
	-  List semantic -  List / ArrayList
	   List semantic is ordered while bag is not
	-  Set semantic - Set
	-  Map semantic - Map
	
-	Cascading
	-	in V91 if user has 100 vehicles she has to save all one by one. 
	-   Although hibernate knows that the vehicle object has a reference in user object
	    it does not saves it. As both are entities and hibernate wants user to be in control
	    off entities. 
	-	but user can override and ask hibernate to auto save when she uses cascade with one to many
	-	Types
		-	PERSIST : cascade while saving the object
		-	REMOVE : cascade while delete the object
		-	ALL :
		-	DETATCH :
		-	MERGE : 
		-	REFRESH :
