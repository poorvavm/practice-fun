 * Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

 * Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions

 * 
 * However, you may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time 
 * (ie, you must sell the stock before you buy again).
