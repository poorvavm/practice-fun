Concepts
----------------------
	-  More efficient use of memory
	-  large number of similar objects
	-  immutable
	-  	Most of the object states can be extrinsic
	-  ex: java.lang.String, java.lang.Integer#valueOf()

Design
-----------------------
	-  Pattern of patterns
	-  Utilizes a Factory 
	-  Encompasses creation and structure
	-  Client, factory, flyweight and ConcreteFlyweight
	 

Pitfalls
----------------------
	-  Complex pattern
	-  Premature optimization
	-  Must understand factory pattern
	-  not a graphical pattern
	
Contrast
----------------------
	-  Flyweight
		-  Memory optimization
		-  Optimization pattern
		-  Immutable objects
	-  Facade
		-  Refactoring pattern
		-  SImplified Client
		-  Provides a different interface
