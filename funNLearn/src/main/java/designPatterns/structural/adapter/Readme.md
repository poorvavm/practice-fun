pitfalls
===========
	-  Multiple adapters
	-  Don't add functionality
	-  with functionality it is decorator pattern
	
Contrast
========
  	-  Adapter
  		-  Works after code is designed
  		-  Legacy
  		-  Retrofitted
  		-  Provides different interface
  	-  Bridge
  		-  Designed upfront
  		-  Abstraction and implementation vary
  		-  Build in advance
  
  -  Both adapt multiple systems
