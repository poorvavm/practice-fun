Concepts
============

	-  Decouple abstraction and implementation
	-  Encapsulation, COmposition, Inheritance
	-  Changes in abstraction won't affect client
	-  Details won't be right
	-  changes from both sides is bridge while changes from one side is adapter
	-  eg: 
		-  Drivers
		-  JDBC

pitfalls
================
	-  Increases complexity
	-  Conceptually difficult to plan
	-  More than just OO
	-  What goes where
	
Comparison
================
	-  Bridge
		-  Designed upfront
		-  abstraction and implementation vary
		-  built in advance
		-  Complex
	-  Adapter
		-  works after code is designed
		-  Legacy code
		-  Retrofitted
		-  Provides different interface
