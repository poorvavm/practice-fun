Abstract Factory Method Pattern
------------------------------------------

	Concepts
	-  Factory of factories
	-  Factory of related objects
	-  Common Interface
	-  	Defer to subclasses
	-  Eg: 
		-  DocumentBuilder
		-  Frameworks
	
	Pitfalls
	-  Complexity
	-  Runtime Switch
	-  Pattern within a pattern
	-  Problem specific
	-  Starts as a factory
	
	Factory
	-  Returns various instances
		-  multiple constructors
	-  Interface driven
	-  Adaptable to environment more easily
	
	AbstractFactory
	-  Everything for Factory holds true here too
	-  Implemented with a factory
	-  Hides the Factory
	-  Abstract Environment
	-  Built through Composition
