/*

  Update the HTML file to include the following validations:

    1. All fields are required.

    2. The favorite number field must be between 1 and 10.

    3. The plate number must be 7 digits in length and only include
       the leters A through Z and the numbers 0 through 9.

  Update the CSS so that:

  1. Required fields that are not valid should have a red border
     around them.

  2. Required fields that are valid should have green text.

  3. Make the form look pretty.
