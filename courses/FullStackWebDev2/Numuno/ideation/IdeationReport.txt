1. Introduction
---------------
If you have to tell me what songs were most popular in the second week of March in 2016, there is no
one place where you can go and find it. Off course you can google it and then match 10 results and
give it to me somehow. But if I ask you about most popular mobile phones, cars, laptops, etc. and
it can be any category during any period of time for a defined cost range. There is no such database
that shows the current and past history of the popularity of any product in a particular category for
a particular price point.

For ex. if I have to buy a refrigerator and my budget is $600.00, there should be a website where I can
check people's ratings for it. List of top 10 refrigerator in this area within price range 500 to 600.

A counter argument can be we can do this currently as well on Amazon, Walmart and other websites. But you
can just see what's current rating. They do not show the trend for any product, media or services.
It is more like Yelp but not restaurant specific and also this can show for how long this particular
item in the category has remained at certain place in the top 10.


2. Expected List of Features
----------------------------
-  Gives you a list of top 10 current items in any category
-  Gives you a list of top 10 current items in any time frame
-  Gives you a list of top 10 current items in any price range
-  Selecting an item can give you it's popularity plot
-  Selecting a category gives user a stock market like plot
-  User's can vote up any item
-  User's can not vote up more than 5 items in 1 day
-  User's can see items that they have liked any time
-  User's can save items in their briefcase.

These feature provides the end to end functionality for the product. and provides
a good platform structure for more features to be supported in the future.

3. Market Survey
----------------
-  Do a survey of the Web to find about five web sites that might have similar ideas as yours.
   Yelp, Amazon, facebook, ebay, pinterest

-  Briefly compare the features of these applications with your application idea.
   All these websites provide what's current. But not one provides what's the past.
   There is a record of data but none of them are putting it out there in a best fashion.
   Also this data can be used further for data analysis in terms of product marketing/trends, and
   competitive analysis.
