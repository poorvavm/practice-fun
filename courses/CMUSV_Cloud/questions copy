  =====================
  Company X is building a data center with 10 4U servers, two 5U storage arrays, and two 1U network switches in a standard-height rack. How many racks will the company need to mount all this hardware?

---- Two racks
  equipment. A standard-height rack is 42U.

  Company X is also considering blade servers with the following specifications: Blade enclosure (chassis): 7U.
  Number of blade servers: 20 servers per 7U chassis. The company is planning to fully populate the rack with servers. Assume that network and power distribution is off rack. How many blade enclosures can fit in a 42U rack?
  ====== The right answer is 42/7 = 6.
  Assuming the blade enclosures are fully populated, how many servers can you fit in a 42U rack?
  ====== The right answer is 6 × 20 = 120.

  Based solely on CPU performance per dollar, which is a better deal for this particular application?
----- opeteron 6278
  Scalability testing showed they would need 80 AMD nodes for their application. How many Intel nodes
  80/1.4 =58

  rounded up to the nearest integer) would they need to run the same application?
  ==== It is the height of the blade enclosures needed, not the number of nodes. The answer is (80servers / 20 servers per enclosure)* 7 U per enclosure = 28 U.
                nodes.
   How many rack units will each solution take up? 
   ==== It is the height of the blade enclosures needed, not the number of nodes. The answer is (80servers / 20 servers per enclosure)* 7 U per enclosure = 28 U.

   What is the total cost of the AMD solution (blades + enclosures)?
   ==== The correct answer is (80 servers * $4875 per server)+ (4 enclosures * $12,200 per enclosure) = $438,800.

   What is the total cost of the Intel solution (blades + enclosures)?
   ==== The correct answer is (58 servers * $6700 per server)+ (3 enclosures * $12,200 per enclosure) = $425,200.

   What is the difference between SATA and SAS drives?
   === SAS allows a single drive to be connected to two controllers for failover redundancy.

   Which of the following is a feature of SSD drives?
   ==== Higher peroformance then spinning drives
   === lower seek time
   === No moving parts
   === do not allow unlimited write operations
    what is the main diffrence between SAN and NAS?
    ==== SAN provide block level storage while NAS support a file system.


   How much aggregate bandwidth does a 2U server with four 10G fiber ports have? 
   ==== The right answer can be calculated as 4 × 10 = 40 Gbit/s.


Assume you have a top-of-rack, 48-port network switch, and each switch has two 10G uplinks. If you want to guarantee a minimum of 500 Mbps upstream to each server (each has a 1G Ethernet connection), what is the maximum number of ports that can be used per switch?
 ====The right answer can be calculated as 20 Gbits ÷ 500 Mbps = 40 ports.

 Which of the following is a characteristic of Infiniband networking?
 === sppeds ranging from 8 Gbit/s to 100 Gbit/s
 === Fully non blocking switch
 ==== End to end latency of less then 2 ms.

 What are the primary design goals when planning, configuring and implementing power distribution for data centers?
 ==== Efficicency and redundancy

 Which of the following is a typical feature in a data center server room?
 === Raised floor
 == Computer room AC
 === Power distribution unit


 Which entity is responsible for selecting the power feed that goes into a data center?
 === Automatic or universal transfer switch


 Why is cooling so important in Data Centers?


 ============================

 If a server's maximum power draw is 300W and its idle power draw is 200W, what is the approximate power draw at 5% utilization?

 Pn =(Pmax − Pidle )×n/100+Pidle   
 205 == 300-200(5/100)+200= 100*5/100+200

==================
You have 200 servers in your organization, each with an average 10% CPU utilization, with Pideal of 200W Pmax of 300W. If you virtualized these and consolidated onto 40 larger servers, each with Pideal of 250W Pmax  of 800W and an average utilization of 50%, how much power (in watts) would you save? 

210W × 200 servers) - (525W × 40 servers) = 42k - 21k.

=====================
if the PUE of the data center is 2.0, and a server in this data center demands 500W of power, what is the power (in watts) from the utility grid that is needed to deliver 500W to the server? 
lower is PUE is good ideal is 1 %
 answer 10000
 ================
 The PUE is a measure of which of the following?
  === How efficiently a datacenter usase power.
  ====================

  You have 12 servers, each with 1 PSU, measured to consume 500W max. You also have three-phase 208V PDUs with multiple branches, each branch with a 20A breaker. How many PDU branches will you need to power the 12 servers?     PDU branches.
  =====Look at the formula above. Make sure you divide by 1.73, and use the derated value of 16A instead of 20A.


  You have a 100kW load and are using an N+1 design for UPS, with 3 + 1 = 4 UPS total.

==== What is the normal load (in kilowatts) of each UPS?  25 KW
What is the maximum load (in kilowatts) each UPS should be capable of handling?  Each UPS should handle at least 33kW.

=====
You have 12 servers, each with dual-redundant PSUs, which are measured together to consume a maximum of 500W. You also have two power feeds (A and B) going to the rack. To each feed, a three-phase 208V PDU is attached. Each PDU has three branches (one per phase), each with a 20A breaker.

Will this be sufficient under normal conditions (both feeds active : Yes
Will this be sufficient (and conform to electrical code) if power feed A fails? No   Although it might not trip the breaker, running a 2000W load through a single branch (16A ×208V/1.73 = 1923W limit) does not conform to code.


===========

Last year, because of a combined power outage and generator failure, your data center was down for 4 hours. What was your availability for 2014 (Assume 365 days in a year, answer correct to four decimal places)? 

==== The answer can be calculated as: 1 - (4/total hours in year). The answer is 99.9543%.
    
For the second year in the life span of those drives, how many of the 20,000 would you expect to fail? 
===  (1/500,000) × hours/year × number of drives. == 8760*20000*1/500000 = 350.4

====================

Considering the same scenario from the previous question, if each drive is part of a two-drive
RAID1 mirror, would you expect to lose any data from a double drive failure on any one of those 10,000 RAID1 arrays during that year? (Also assume that a failed drive is replaced immediately, and no additional drives fail during rebuild.)
(1/500,000 power 2) * hours/year* number of arrey


Correct! Although it might not trip the breaker, running a 2000W load through a single branch (16A ×208V/1.73 = 1923W limit) does not conform to code.
