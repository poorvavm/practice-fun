# Deploy multi-tier application
This lab shows you how to build and deploy a simple, multi-tier web application using Kubernetes. 

We will be deploying the guestbook demo application which is made up of Redis master, Redis slave, and guestbook frontend. 

## Start up Redis Master 
The guestbook application uses Redis to store its data. It writes data to a Redis master instance and reads data from multiple Redis slave instances.

### Creating the Redis Master Deployment 
The manifest file, included below, specifies a Deployment controller that runs a single replica Redis master Pod.

Apply the Redis Master deployment file 
```
kubectl apply -f manifests/redis-master-deployment.yaml
```

Verify the Redis master is running 
```
kubectl get pods
```
You should see something like: 
```
NAME                            READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
redis-master-585798d8ff-s9qmr   1/1       Running   0          44s
```

Now let’s check the logs 
```
kubectl logs -f <POD NAME>
```

If everything looks good continue 

### Create the Redis Master Service 
The guestbook applications needs to communicate to the Redis master to write its data. You need to apply a Service to proxy the traffic to the Redis master Pod. A Service defines a policy to access the Pods.

Apply the Service 
```
kubectl apply -f manifests/redis-master-service.yaml
```

This manifest file creates a Service named redis-master with a set of labels that match the labels previously defined, so the Service routes network traffic to the Redis master Pod.

Confirm service is running 
```
kubectl get svc 
```

You should see running service 
```
NAME           TYPE        CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE
kubernetes     ClusterIP   10.96.0.1      <none>        443/TCP    34m
redis-master   ClusterIP   10.107.62.78   <none>        6379/TCP   56s
```

## Start up the Redis Slaves
Although the Redis master is a single pod, you can make it highly available to meet traffic demands by adding replica Redis slaves.

### Create Redis Slave Deployment 
Deployments scale based off of the configurations set in the manifest file. In this case, the Deployment object specifies two replicas.
If there are not any replicas running, this Deployment would start the two replicas on your container cluster. Conversely, if there are more than two replicas are running, it would scale down until two replicas are running.

Apply the Redis slave deployment 
```
kubectl apply -f manifests/redis-slave-deployment.yaml
```

Confirm it’s running successfully. 
```
kubectl get pods
```

You should now see the following 
```
NAME                            READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
redis-master-585798d8ff-s9qmr   1/1       Running   0          6m
redis-slave-865486c9df-bf68k    1/1       Running   0          8s
redis-slave-865486c9df-btg6h    1/1       Running   0          8s
```

### Create Redis Slave service 
The guestbook application needs to communicate to Redis slaves to read data. To make the Redis slaves discoverable, you need to set up a Service. A Service provides transparent load balancing to a set of Pods.

Apply Redis Slave Service 
```
kubectl apply -f manifests/redis-slave-service.yaml
```

Confirm services are running 
```
kubectl get services
```

You should see: 
```
NAME           TYPE        CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE
kubernetes     ClusterIP   10.96.0.1      <none>        443/TCP    38m
redis-master   ClusterIP   10.107.62.78   <none>        6379/TCP   5m
redis-slave    ClusterIP   10.98.54.128   <none>        6379/TCP   35s
```

## Setup and Expose the Guestbook Frontend 
The guestbook application has a web frontend serving the HTTP requests written in PHP. It is configured to connect to the `redis-master` Service for write requests and the `redis-slave` service for Read requests.

## Create the Guestbook Frontend Deployment
Apply the YAML file
```
kubectl apply -f manifests/frontend-deployment.yaml
```

Now let’s verify they are running 
```
kubectl get pods -l app=guestbook -l tier=frontend
```

You should see something like this 
```
NAME                       READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
frontend-67f65745c-jwhdw   1/1       Running   0          27s
frontend-67f65745c-lxpxj   1/1       Running   0          27s
frontend-67f65745c-tsq9k   1/1       Running   0          27s
```

### Create the Frontend Service
The `redis-slave` and `redis-master` Services you applied are only accessible within the container cluster because the default type for a Service is `ClusterIP`. ClusterIP provides a single IP address for the set of Pods the Service is pointing to. This IP address is accessible only within the cluster.

If you want guests to be able to access your guestbook, you must configure the frontend Service to be externally visible, so a client can request the Service from outside the container cluster.

Apply the Frontend Service
```
kubectl apply -f manifests/frontend-service.yaml
```

Confirm the service is running 
```
kubectl get services
```

You should see something like this 
```
NAME           TYPE        CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)        AGE
frontend       NodePort    10.107.73.47   103.21.23.45  80:31495/TCP   34s
kubernetes     ClusterIP   10.96.0.1      <none>        443/TCP        44m
redis-master   ClusterIP   10.107.62.78   <none>        6379/TCP       11m
redis-slave    ClusterIP   10.98.54.128   <none>        6379/TCP       6m
```

### Viewing the Frontend Service 
To load the front end in a browser visit localhost on port `8081`


## Scale Web Frontend 
Scaling up or down is easy because your servers are defined as a Service that uses a Deployment controller.

Run the following command to scale up the number of frontend Pods:
```
kubectl scale deployment frontend --replicas=5
```

Now verify the Pods increased to specified number of replicas
```
kubectl get pods -l app=guestbook -l tier=frontend
```

To scale back down run 
```
kubectl scale deployment frontend --replicas=2
```

Now check to see if Pods are being destroyed 
```
kubectl get pods -l app=guestbook -l tier=frontend
```

To clean up everything run 
```
kubectl delete deployment -l app=redis
kubectl delete service -l app=redis
kubectl delete deployment -l app=guestbook
kubectl delete service -l app=guestbook
```

Confirm everything was deleted 
```
kubectl get pods
```
